# Product Management

## Introduction to Product Management
### What is a Product Manager?
- You're not a manager of anybody. Nobody reports to you.
- A product manager sits in between different functions and acts as an
  - Communications Hub
  - Organizer
  - Enabler
- A product manager:
  - Talks to various stakeholders and users
  - Receives feedback
  - Looks at metrics
  - Decides what things can be built next
  - Which of those things is is most important
  - How to best utilize time and resources
- A product manager is responsible for the success of a product

### What is a Product?
Could be a whole product eg. a device or a software or it could be a segment of the product eg. a feature.

### Who are stakeholders?
Stakeholders are people that you are building for or have an input into what you are building. Examples of stakeholders:
- Users
- Executives
- Legal Team (to make sure what you're building does not get the company into legal trouble)
- Marketing Team (to make sure they get to market good stuff)
- Sales Team (might be involved very directly in determining and translating the business requests)

### Types of Product Managers
The three types, differnetiated by their stakeholders, are:
- **Internal PMs**: 
  - Usually PM for company's internal tools
  - Features are driven by stakeholders
  - Great role if you are new to being PM
  - Integrate feature with other systems
  - More Project management
  - Lesser risk

- **Consumer PMs**: 
  - B2C PMs where the product is for the average public user.
  - Eg: Facebook timeline will have a B2C 
  - No one is there to tell them that feature X is the next best thing to build next
  - May involve uncertainty and pressure
  - Millions of users
  - Multiple platforms
  - Can lose company $ therefore high risk
  - Extensive user testing
  - Uncertain as to what you should build next

- **B2B PMs (SAAS PMs)**:
  - Builds products whose clients are other companies
  - Eg: Oracle, SalesForce
  - Interacts with Sales team of their own company to understand business requirements
  - Features are driven by client
  - Good intro role as well
  - Smaller # of users
  - Lower risk as compared to consumer
  - Priorities weighted by $
  - Tight deadlines


### Differences between product and project management
Product Management | Project Management
--- | ---
Responsible for the success of a product where success is defined by KPIs or metrics. |  Responsible for accomplishing a project, not a goal. 
Example of a product: timeline feature on Facebook | Example of project: merger of two companies
There is room for creativity, experimentation and innovation | There is lack of room for creativity, experimentation and innovation. Instead a project usually has a timeline and budget as a constraint.


## Introduction to Product Development

### 4 Major Phases of the Product Lifecycle
- Introduction
  - Product first introduced to market
  - Little to no competition
  - Typically loses $
  - Customers are usually the early adopters
  - Example: any product being developed by a startup
- Growth
  - Accepted by market
  - Sales rise (from the tail end of the early adopters)
  - Company starts to improve product to stay competitive
  - Few competitors
  - Example: Grab/Gojek
- Maturity
  - Sales peak
  - Competitors enter market
  - Example: Twitter
- Decline
  - Sales diminish
  - Products phased out
  - Deemed old/irrelevant
  - Example: Yahoo

## Agile

### What is agile?
- Lean is a product development philosophy of cutting out unnecessary effort to build a product. 
- Agile is an iterative lean software development process.
- We group things in small batches and do them in order to not waste resources.

### Scrum
1. Sprint Planning meeting
 - Product backlog (a wishlist of all the features) -> Sprint backlog
 - Talk about what work needs to be done for that sprint
 - Develop tickets out of tasks
2. Using Tickets
  - Work on the tickets
3. Standup Meetings
  - Every team member talks about what they worked on so far, what are they going to work on next
  - Ask for help, talk about blockage
4. Retrospective Meetings?
  - What went well?
  - What did not go well?
  - What questions do people have?

### Kanban
- Not as strict as scrum in terms of meetings. 
- It does not have any sprints
- No sprint backlogs only a product backlog
- Does not prescribe any special type of meetings
- Only a certain number of items can be in progress at one time
- Eg: customer service teams/IT-request teams use Kanban style since there is more focus on clearing tickets than a timeline
